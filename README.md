# <img width="32px" src="./public/images/wifi.png"> WiFi Card (SVG version)

https://chocobo1.github.io/wifi-card-svg/

This is a fork of [bndw/wifi-card](https://github.com/bndw/wifi-card) project.

It includes some features that are out of scope of the original project:
1. Show QR code in SVG image \
   Needless to say, vector images is sharper and clearer than raster images. And it scales well to any resolution.
2. Add a button to save QR code image \
   It helps when you only want the image and store it elsewhere.
